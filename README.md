This is a VS Code Notebook for F# Koans, converted from https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans

To run this, use VS Code Insiders and install the ".NET Interactive Notebooks" extension, then load this file.
Expect to wait a while on first load while VS Code downloads and installs the .NET Interactive engine, then the
notebook should load. Then follow the instructions in the notebook.
