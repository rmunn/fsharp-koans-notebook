# F# Koans

This is a VS Code notebook that will teach you how to use F#.

## First steps

To begin, please click the "Execute Cell" button (a right-pointing triangle) in the code section immediately below. This will set up the necessary functions for running the rest of the tutorial. Once you've done that, you can hide this section as you'll no longer need it. Do that by clicking on the down-facing arrow to the left of the "F# Koans" title.

#!fsharp

open System
[<AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class ||| AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false)>]
type KoanAttribute () =
    inherit Attribute()
    let mutable sortOrder = 0
    member x.Sort
        with get() = sortOrder
        and set(v) = sortOrder <- v

let inline __<'T> : 'T = failwith "Seek wisdom by filling in the __"

type FILL_ME_IN =
    class end

type FILL_IN_THE_EXCEPTION() =
    inherit Exception()

let green text =
    let fgColor = Console.ForegroundColor
    Console.ForegroundColor <- ConsoleColor.Green
    printfn text
    Console.ForegroundColor <- fgColor

let assertEqual a b =
    if a = b then "✔ Solved!" else failwithf "Expected %A but got %A" a b

let assertNotEqual a b =
    if a = b then failwithf "Expected a value not equal to %A got %A" a b else "✔ Solved!"

let AssertWithMessage (x : bool) message =
    if x then () else failwith message

let inline AssertEquality (x:'T) (y:'T) =
    match box y with
    | :? System.Type as t when t = typeof<FILL_ME_IN> -> failwith "Seek wisdom by correcting the type FILL_ME_IN"
    | :? System.Type as t when t = typeof<FILL_IN_THE_EXCEPTION> -> failwith "Seek wisdom by correcting the type FILL_IN_THE_EXCEPTION"
    | _ -> assertEqual x y

let AssertInequality (x:'T) (y:'T) = assertNotEqual x y

let AssertThrows<'a when 'a :> exn> action =
    try
        action()
    with
    | :? 'a -> "✔ Solved!"
    | e ->
        let tActual : Type = e.GetType()
        let tExpected = typeof<'a>
        failwithf "Expected an exception of type %s but got an exception of type %s instead: %s" tExpected.Name tActual.Name (e.ToString())

let Assert (x : bool) = AssertWithMessage x "Expected a true value but got false"

# Exercises

This is where the fun begins! Each koan contains an example designed to teach you a lesson about the F# language. If you execute the cell below, you will get a message that the AssertEquality koan below has failed. Your job is to fill in the blank (the \_\_ symbol) to make it pass. Once you make the change, re-run the cell to make sure the koan passes, and continue on to the next koan. With each passing koan, you'll learn more about F#, and add another weapon to your F# programming arsenal.

**NOTE**: If you see an exception about "The value of constructor '\_\_' is not defined" and/or "The value or constructor 'AssertEquality' is not defined.", then you have not yet run the helper code in the first cell of this notebook. Please go back and execute the first cell in this notebook, then the koans below should work properly.

## Exercise 1: Check that things are set up right

#!fsharp

let expected_value = 1 + 1
let actual_value = 2 //start by changing this line

AssertEquality expected_value actual_value
 

#!fsharp

AssertEquality (1 + 1) 2

#!markdown

## Exercise 2: About `let`

The `let` keyword is one of the most fundamental parts of F#. You'll use it in almost every line of F# code you write, so let's get to know it well! (no pun intended)

#!markdown

`let` binds a name to a value

#!fsharp

let x = 50

AssertEquality x __

#!markdown

`let` infers the types of values where possible.

#!fsharp

let x = 50
let typeOfX = x.GetType()
AssertEquality typeOfX typeof<int>

let y = "a string"
let expectedType = y.GetType()
AssertEquality expectedType typeof<FILL_ME_IN>

#!markdown

You can make types explicit.  You don't usually need to provide explicit type annotations types for local variables, but type annotations can come in handy in other contexts as you'll see later.

#!fsharp

let (x:int) = 42
let typeOfX = x.GetType()

let y:string = "forty two"
let typeOfY = y.GetType()

AssertEquality typeOfX typeof<FILL_ME_IN>
AssertEquality typeOfY typeof<FILL_ME_IN>

#!markdown

Depending on your background, you may be surprised to learn that in F#, integers and floating point numbers are different types. In other words, the following is true.

#!fsharp

let x = 20
let typeOfX = x.GetType()

let y = 20.0
let typeOfY = y.GetType()

// You don't need to modify these
AssertEquality typeOfX typeof<int>
AssertEquality typeOfY typeof<float>

// If you're coming from another .NET language, float is F# slang for the double type.

#!markdown

If you want to modify the value of a variable, use the `mutable` keyword. If you don't use the `mutable` keyword, values cannot be modified.

#!fsharp

let mutable x = 100
x <- 200

AssertEquality x __

let y = 50

//What happens if you uncomment the following?
//
//y <- 100

AssertEquality y __

#!markdown

## Exercise 3: About functions

Now that you've seen how to bind a name to a value with `let`, you'll learn to use the `let` keyword to create functions.

#!markdown

By default, F# is whitespace sensitive. For functions, this means that the last line of a function is its return value, and the body of a function is denoted by indentation.

#!fsharp

let add x y =
    x + y

#!markdown

You call functions by writing their name and their parameter list separated by spaces. No parentheses or commas necessary, except in special cases we'll learn about later.

#!fsharp

let result1 = add 2 2
let result2 = add 5 2

AssertEquality result1 __
AssertEquality result2 __

#!markdown

Function definitions can be nested. The inner function is visible only inside the function that defines it. This allows for encapsulation.

#!fsharp

let quadrupleOf x =
    let doubleOf x =
        x * 2

    doubleOf(doubleOf(x))

let result = quadrupleOf 4
AssertEquality result __

// What happens if you uncomment this?
// let result2 = doubleOf 2
// result2

#!markdown

Sometimes you need to help F#'s type inference system out with an explicit type annotation. This happens most often when you're calling an instance method on a function parameter. For example, in the function below F# can infer that your parameter is a class with a `Replace` method, but without a type annotation F# can't tell whether `text` is a string or a `Regex` instance, or maybe even some other class that has a `Replace` method (say, a `List`). Try removing the type annotation and see what happens.

#!fsharp

let sayItLikeAnAuctioneer (text:string) =
    text.Replace(" ", "")

let auctioneered = sayItLikeAnAuctioneer "going once going twice sold to the lady in red"
AssertEquality auctioneered __

#!markdown

Inside a function, variables in the parent scope are accessible. This is known as a [closure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)).

#!fsharp

let suffix = "!!!"

let caffeinate (text:string) =
    let exclaimed = text.Trim() + suffix
    let yelled = exclaimed.ToUpper()
    yelled

let caffeinatedReply = caffeinate "hello there"

AssertEquality caffeinatedReply __

#!markdown

## Exercise 4: About the order of evaluation

Sometimes you'll need to be explicit about the order in which functions are evaluated. F# offers a couple mechanisms for doing this.

#!markdown

Sometimes you need parentheses to group things, such as function calls inside a different function's parameter list.

#!fsharp

let add x y =
    x + y

let result = add (add 5 8) (add 1 1)

AssertEquality result __

// What happens if you remove the parentheses? Try it and see.

#!markdown

The "backward pipe" operator `<|` can also help with grouping, as it can remove the need for a pair of parentheses. Think of it as "take the expression on the right, and feed it into the function on the left".

#!fsharp

let add x y =
    x + y

let double x =
    x * 2

let result = double <| add 5 8

AssertEquality result __

// Equivalent:
let result2 = double (add 5 8)
AssertEquality result result2

#!markdown

There's also a "forward pipe" operator `|>` which takes the expression on the left and feeds it into the function on the right. We'll learn more about it in exercise __ ((FILL THIS IN)).

#!fsharp

let add x y =
    x + y

let double x =
    x * 2

let result = add 5 8 |> double

AssertEquality result 26

// Equivalent:
let result2 = double (add 5 8)
AssertEquality result result2

#!markdown

## Exercise 5: About the `unit` type

The `unit` type is a special type that represents the lack of a value. It's similar to void in other languages, but unit is actually considered to be a type in F#. It is a type with one (and only one) possible value, written as `()`.

#!markdown

The `unit` type is used when there is no return value for a function.

#!fsharp

let sendData data =
    // ...sending the data to the server...
    ()

let x = sendData "data"
AssertEquality x __ // Don't overthink this. Note also the value "()" displays as "null" in some cases.

#!markdown

Parameterless functions in F# are considered to take one parameter, of type `unit`.

#!fsharp

let sayHello() =
    "hello"

let result = sayHello()
AssertEquality result __

#!markdown

## Exercise 6: About tuples

Tuples are used to easily group together values in F#. They're another fundamental construct of the language.

#!markdown

Tuples are defined by listing a number of items, separated by commas. Parentheses around the tuple are optional, but recommended in most situations.

#!fsharp

let items = "apple", "dog"  // Parentheses around the tuple are optional here

AssertEquality items ("apple", __)  // But here you'll get a syntax error if you omit the parentheses. Try it and see what happens.

#!markdown

There are several ways to access items inside a tuple. For 2-item tuples, F# has a pair of functions `fst` and `snd` that you can use. They do not work on tuples of arity 3 or more, though.

#!fsharp

let items = ("apple", "dog")

let fruit = fst items
let animal = snd items

AssertEquality fruit "apple"
AssertEquality animal "dog"

// Try uncommenting this and see what happens
// let items3 = ("apple", "dog", "Mustang")
// fst items3

#!markdown

For tuples of arity greater than 2, it's usually better to use a technique called pattern matching to access the values of a tuple.

Pattern matching works with tuples of any arity, and it allows you to simultaneously break apart the tuple while assigning a name to each value. Here's an example.

#!fsharp

let items = ("apple", "dog", "Mustang")

let fruit, animal, car = items

AssertEquality fruit __
AssertEquality animal __
AssertEquality car __

#!markdown

When pattern matching, you can use the special name `_` (a single underscore) to match any parts of the tuple you don't care about. Multiple `_` can be used in the same pattern-matching expression.

Pattern matching is used in many other parts of F#, and we'll revisit it again later.

#!fsharp

let items = ("apple", "dog", "Mustang")

let _, animal, _ = items

AssertEquality animal __

#!markdown

Tuples are also useful for returning multiple values from a function.

#!fsharp

let squareAndCube x =
    (x ** 2.0, x ** 3.0)

let squared, cubed = squareAndCube 3.0

// Remember that ints are different than floats in F#. Don't write 3 if you meant to write 3.0
AssertEquality squared __
AssertEquality cubed __

#!markdown

Think about the `squareAndCube` function. Is there really more than one return value? What type does the `squareAndCube` function return?

#!fsharp

// The truth behind multiple return values

let squareAndCube x =
    (x ** 2.0, x ** 3.0)

let result = squareAndCube 3.0

AssertEquality result __
